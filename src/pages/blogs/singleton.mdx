## Describe
> The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is used when you want to control the instantiation of a class to ensure there's only one instance throughout the lifetime of the application.

```python
import sqlite3

class DatabaseConnection:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, database_name):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(DatabaseConnection, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.connection = sqlite3.connect(database_name)
        return cls._instance

    def execute_query(self, query):
        cursor = self.connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query)
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        cursor.close()
        return result
```
## Benefit and Drawback
### Benefit 
1. ***Controlled Access***: Singleton ensures a single point of access to an object, which is particularly useful when resources like database connections or hardware devices need to be shared.

2. ***Resource Sharing***: It allows for efficient resource sharing because only one instance of the object is created, saving memory and resources.

### Drawback
1. Overuse of Singleton can lead to tight coupling in your code, making it less maintainable and testable

## Use Cases 
* ***Database Connections***: Singleton is commonly used to manage database connections in an application. It ensures that multiple parts of the codebase share the same database connection, preventing excessive resource usage.
* ***Logging***: When you want to maintain a single log file or logger instance throughout the application, Singleton can ensure that log messages are consistently written to the same file.
* ***Caching***: Singleton can be used to manage a cache that stores frequently used data or objects.
* ***Configuration Management***: It's helpful for managing application configuration settings that should remain consistent throughout the program's execution.
* ***ThreadPools***: In multi-threaded environments, Singleton can be used to create and manage a limited number of worker threads.
