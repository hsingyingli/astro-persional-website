## Single Responsibility Principle (ISP) states
> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does not use, or clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.


## Example with Violation (Invalid)
```js
class Square {
  setWidth(width) {}
  ...

  volume() {}
}

class Cube extends Square {
  setWidth(width) {}
  volume() {}
}
```
why does it valid ISP?
Any Flat square your create must be implement volume function that it has no use of.

## Benefits of ISP 
1. Reduced coupling: Classes depend on smaller, more specific interfaces, which decreases unnecessary dependencies between classes.
2. Improved maintainability: Changes to an interface won't impact classes that don't use the modified methods.
3. Better cohesion: Interfaces are tailored to the exact needs of the client classes, promoting clearer responsibilities and a more cohesive design.
