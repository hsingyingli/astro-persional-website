## Describe
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction (an interface or abstract class) from its implementation. It allows these two aspects to vary independently, making it possible to develop more flexible and maintainable software systems.

### Core Concept
 The key idea is to ***<ins>decouple an abstraction from its concrete implementations</ins>***, allowing changes in either without affecting the other.
 ```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Implementor Interface
class Color(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def apply_color(self):
        pass

# Concrete Implementors
class RedColor(Color):
    def apply_color(self):
        return "Red"

class BlueColor(Color):
    def apply_color(self):
        return "Blue"

# Abstraction
class Shape(ABC):
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

# Refined Abstractions
class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return f"Drawing a Circle in {self.color.apply_color()}"

class Square(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        return f"Drawing a Square in {self.color.apply_color()}"

# Usage
red_circle = Circle(RedColor())
blue_square = Square(BlueColor())

print(red_circle.draw())   # print: "Drawing a Circle in Red"
print(blue_square.draw())  # print: "Drawing a Square in Blue"
 ```

## Benefit and Drawback
* Benefit
  1. Separation of Concerns: The Bridge Pattern separates the abstraction from the implementation, promoting a clean separation of concerns. This makes it easier to make changes in one part of the system without affecting the other.
  2. Extensibility: The Bridge Pattern is especially useful when you have a hierarchy of both abstractions and implementations, making it easier to extend the system in a salable way.

* Drawback
  1. Complexity: Implementing the Bridge Pattern can introduce additional complexity, especially when there are many abstractions and implementations. It may not be justified for simple systems.

## Use Cases
* Database Drivers: When developing database connectivity libraries, the Bridge Pattern can be used to separate the high-level query interface (abstraction) from the specific database drivers (implementation).
* Device Drivers: In embedded systems or hardware programming, the Bridge Pattern can be applied to separate the abstraction of a device's functionality from the underlying hardware details.
