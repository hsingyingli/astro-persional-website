## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. 
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## Key Points
1. Inversion of Control (IoC):  Control of object creation and handling dependencies is inverted to a higher level in the application.

2. Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection allows high-level modules to be provided with their dependencies (low-level modules) ***from external sources***.

3. Abstraction: 
Introducing abstractions, such as interfaces or abstract classes, helps in decoupling high-level modules from low-level modules. 
High-level modules ***depend on these abstractions*** instead of concrete implementations.

## From tightly Coupled to Loosely Coupled
> tightly coupled -> IoC -> DIP -> loosely couple
### Tightly Coupled Classes
```js
// Tightly Coupled Classes (Initial State)
class EmailService {
  sendEmail(to, content) {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${to}: ${content}`);
  }
}

class Order {
  constructor() {
    this.emailService = new EmailService(); // Direct dependency, tightly coupled.
  }

  placeOrder(customerEmail, orderContent) {
    ...
    this.emailService.sendEmail(customerEmail, orderContent);
  }
}

const order = new Order();
order.placeOrder('customer@example.com', 'Product: XYZ, Quantity: 2');
```
The Order class directly creates an instance of the EmailService class, creating tight coupling between them. If we change EmailService class, we need to change Order class too.


### IoC 
#### How to implement IoC principle?
1. Service Locator(pattern)
2. Factory(pattern)
3. Dependency Injection(pattern)

...

Let's use Dependency Injection to implement IoC.

```ts
// Abstractions (Interfaces)
// High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. 

interface EmailServiceInterface {
  sendEmail(to: string, content: string): void;
}

interface OrderProcessorInterface {
  processOrder(customerEmail: string, orderContent: string): void;
}

// Low-Level Module
class EmailService implements IEmailService {
  sendEmail(to: string, content: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${to}: ${content}`);
  }
}

// High-Level Module with Dependency Inversion (Dependency Injection)
class OrderProcessor implements IOrderProcessor {
  private emailService: IEmailService;

  constructor(emailService: IEmailService) {
    this.emailService = emailService;
  }

  processOrder(customerEmail: string, orderContent: string): void {
    ...
    this.emailService.sendEmail(customerEmail, orderContent);
  }
}
```

## Benefits of DIP 
1. Reduced coupling: High-level modules are no longer tightly coupled to low-level modules, making it easier to modify or replace implementations without affecting the high-level logic.
2. Flexibility: Different implementations of the same abstraction (interface) can be easily swapped, promoting flexibility and adaptability in the system.
3. Testability: Dependency injection facilitates easier testing by allowing the injection of mock or fake implementations during testing.
